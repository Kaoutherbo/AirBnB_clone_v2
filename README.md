# AirBnB_clone_v2
The goal of this AirBnB project is to develop and deploy a simplified version of the AirBnB website, called HBnB. This project includes creating a command interpreter to manage various objects for the HBnB website. The command interpreter allows for object creation, retrieval, manipulation, updating, and deletion.

# Functionalities of this command interpreter:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
